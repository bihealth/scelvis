Single Cell Gene Expression Dataset by Cell Ranger 3.0.0 (downloaded from [here](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/hgmm_1k_v3))

1:1 mixture of fresh frozen human (HEK293T) and mouse (NIH3T3) cells. This is a classic human-mouse mixture experiment to demonstrate single cell behavior (the same cells were used to generate hgmm_1k_v2, hgmm_5k_v3, hgmm_10k_v3).

* 1,046 cells detected
* Sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq with approximately 60,000 reads per cell
* 28bp read1 (16bp Chromium barcode and 12bp UMI), 91bp read2 (transcript), and 8bp I7 sample barcode
* run using `cellranger` v3.0.2 with `--expect-cells=1000`
* clustering and marker discovery from `cellranger`
